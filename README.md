## Description
This project was created to help us learn APIs. In this particular case we are using MailChimp's API to create a newsletter signup page. This page will allow the user to input their name and e-mail address which will then be sent over to MailChimp for us take hold of that data.

## Objective
- Sending monthly emails to the users who have signed up for the newsletter to send them news and updates on new tools and technologies

##  Tools

  Used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js and JavaScript to develop the Signup Page.

## How to sign up Newsletter Page

- On the home page, the user can see a simple UI to sign up
- All the fields are mandatory
- When user fills up all the fields, the sign up button can be clicked
- If successful, user is taken to a success page, else a failure page is displayed
- When something goes wrong and failure page is displayed, user can click on Try Again button to go back to the sign up home page.
